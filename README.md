# Repository Description ðŸ“˜

This repository contains a collection of exercises and solutions focused on fundamental programming concepts in **C**, with an emphasis on data structures and memory management. It is designed to practice and deepen the understanding of the following topics:

- **Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists, along with common operations (insertion, deletion, search, etc.).
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` to efficiently allocate and manage memory.
- **Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees**: Creation, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), insertion, deletion, and searching within binary and binary search trees.
- **String Manipulation**: Operations such as concatenation, searching, tokenization, and custom string handling functions.

## Purpose ðŸŽ¯

This repository aims to:

1. Strengthen fundamental knowledge of data structures and memory management in **C**.
2. Provide practical examples and well-commented code for students, enthusiasts, and anyone looking to enhance their programming skills.
